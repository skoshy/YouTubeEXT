## What are all the hotkeys I can use?

- **Alt+O** will disable all styling on the page
- **Shift+PageUp** will increase the brightness of the video
- **Shift+PageDown** will decrease the brightness.

## How do I install it?

1. Get [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or another userscript manager
2. Install via GitHub by [clicking here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skoshy/YoutubeEXT/master/userscript.user.js).

This script is also cross-posted to [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/21012-youtubeext)

## Known Issues

- When Chromecasting a video, the page looks a little weird with elements placed strangely. Temporarily turn off the script using the hotkey specified above to avoid the issue.
